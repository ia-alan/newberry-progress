"""
Refresh index.html (the live partner-facing site) with current shipment
progress from archive.org. This is the version that runs in CI (GitHub
Actions) — it has no dependency on any local files, only what's checked
into this repo (this script, index.html, stub_seeds.json).

Run manually with:

    python3 update_site.py

Normally run automatically by .github/workflows/update.yml on a schedule.

It pulls every SEARCHABLE archive.org item in the target collection, groups
by the grouping field (e.g. shiptracking), and additionally recovers "stub"
items that archive.org excludes from search entirely (metadata field
noindex:true — commonly used for items that are received/reserved but not
yet fully processed). Those stubs are invisible to any search query, so this
script finds them a different way: for group codes whose searchable
identifiers follow a detectable "prefix + sequential number" pattern (e.g.
smithfam04, smithfam05, ...), it directly probes archive.org/metadata/<id>
for the full number range (including gaps and a run past the highest known
number) to recover the true total. Group codes with no searchable items at
all (a brand new shipment that hasn't had anything indexed yet) can only be
found this way if you seed one known identifier for them in
stub_seeds.json — see that file for the format.

A shipment counts as "active" if it has had a completion or a newly-added
stub item within ACTIVE_WINDOW_DAYS.

Everything else in the HTML (layout, styling) is left untouched — this
script only ever rewrites the single-line `const SHIPMENTS = {...};` and
`const SNAPSHOT_DATE = "...";` statements.

See the skill's SKILL.md and README.md before adapting the CONFIG block
below to a new partner/collection — in particular, verify the noindex/stub
phenomenon actually exists for the new collection before assuming this whole
pipeline is necessary; some collections may not need it at all (see
"Step 2: check whether stub discovery is even needed" in SKILL.md).
